I'm studying about TypeScript Compiler API. I found this helpful official source below.

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API

In this repository, I'd like to figure out what each API is doing.
If you find any mistakes, or additional knowledge, I'd love to hear! Please feel free to add issues/PRs.
